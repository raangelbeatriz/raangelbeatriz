### Hi 
  I'm Beatriz, but you can call me Bia, I'm a 22 years old Brazilian developer and enthusiastic about all tech-related things. I'm pursuing both an Information System and Digital Games degree. I like to code a bunch of different things, but my main focus is mobile and game dev. Right now I'm mostly working with flutter and also making games with unity in c#.

<br>Besides coding, which I also like to think of as a hobby, I'm also an avid reader and series addict. Anyway, you can also find me on IG where I share my journey in tech <a href="https://www.instagram.com/developerbia/">@developerbia</a>.

<br> You can see a few games I've been developing here <a href="https://beatrizrangel.itch.io/">my itch io page</a>.
