### Hi 
  I'm Beatriz, but you can call me Bia, I'm a 22 years old Brazilian developer and enthusiastic about all tech-related things. I'm pursuing both an Information System and Digital Games degree. I like to code a bunch of different things, but my main focus is mobile and game dev.Besides coding, which I also like to think of as a hobby, I'm also an avid reader and series addict. Anyway, you can also find me on IG where I share my journey in tech @developerbia.
