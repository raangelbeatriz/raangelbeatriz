### Hi 
  I'm Beatriz, but you can call me Bia, I'm a 24 years old Brazilian developer and enthusiastic about all tech-related things. I have a bachelor degree in Information Systems, and I'm also pursuing another one in Game Development. I like to code a lot of different things, but my main focus is mobile and game development. Right now, I'm mostly working with flutter and also making games with unity in c#.

<br>Besides coding, which I also like to think of as a hobby, I'm also an avid reader and series addict.</a>

<br> You can see a few games I've been developing here <a href="https://beatrizrangel.itch.io/">my itch io page</a>.
